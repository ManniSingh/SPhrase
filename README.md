abstract="We propose a new word embedding model, called SPhrase, that incorporates supervised phrase information. Our method modifies traditional word embeddings by ensuring that all target words in a phrase have exactly the same context. We demonstrate that including this information within a context window produces superior embeddings for both intrinsic evaluation tasks and downstream extrinsic tasks.",
